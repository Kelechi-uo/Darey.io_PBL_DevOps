## What is MERN stack?

MERN stack is a collection of technologies that enables faster application development. It is used by developers worldwide. The main purpose of using MERN stack is to develop apps using JavaScript only. This is because the four technologies that make up the technology stack are all JS-based. Thus, if one knows JavaScript (and JSON), the backend, frontend, and database can be operated easily. 

## MERN Stack Full Form

MERN Stack is a compilation of four different technologies (MongoDB, Express, React / Redux, and Node.js) that work together to develop dynamic web apps and websites. 

It is a contraction for four different technologies as mentioned below:

1. Database  
**MongoDB** is a NoSQL DBMS where data is stored in the form of documents having key-value pairs similar to JSON objects. MongoDB enables users to create databases, schemas, and tables. It offers the Mongo shell that provides a JS interface for deleting, querying, and updating the records.

2. Backend Framework  
**ExpressJS** is a NodeJS framework that simplifies writing the backend code. It saves you from creating multiple Node modules. For keeping the code precise, ExpressJS offers a range of middleware.

3. Frontend Library  
**ReactJS** is a javascript library that allows the development of user interfaces for mobile apps and SPAs (Single Page Applications). It allows you to code JavaScript and develop UI components. The JS library uses virtual DOM for doing everything.

4. Runtime Environment  
**NodeJS** is an open-source JavaScript runtime environment that allows users to run code on the server. It comes with the node package manager or npm, enabling users to select from a wide selection of node modules or packages. Being developed on the Chrome JavaScript Engine enables Node to execute code faster.
